## Tie-Fighter ShootEmDown
 A top-down shooter game created with pygame.
 Tie-fighters have invaded! You play as resistance leader Poe Dameron; shoot down first-order fighters before they crash into your ship. Use your bullets wisely -- you can only shoot three at a time. Level difficulty increases as each fleet of fighters is destroyed.
 
 - arrow keys to move
 - spacebar to fire bullets
 - 't' to fire proton torpedos
 
 Have fun!
